# RIP Validator

This project defines a Python package which validates a directory containing a DIP and its associated metadata to confirm whether or not it is legal as a RIP. Validation includes: 
1. Confirmation that all expected files exist. 
2. Adherence to the WAVES DAML format for dataset-level metadata. 
3. Adherence to the WAVES MAML format for data product-level metadata. 
4. Adherence to the WAVES Style Standards.
